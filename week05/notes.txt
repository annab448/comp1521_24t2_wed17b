this week:
tutorial code for this week:
printer.c: using bits as flags, checking, setting, toggling, unsetting bits

plus some we didn't have time for!
- reverseWord.c: using a for loop to look at one bit at a time

also added some pics of the base conversion/bitwise calculations :)

happy flex week!
